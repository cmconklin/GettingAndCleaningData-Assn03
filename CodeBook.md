Below is the original features_info.txt file unedited as provided by the authors.

for the tidy dataset subjects_mean_std.txt, the labels or activity names are unchanged.  Note that in subjects_mean_std.txt, only the activities where the mean or std are included.  Plus within these activities only mean is records grouped by subject.

Also note the descript of column names are described as: 

	tBodyAcc-XYZ

	- mean(): Mean value
	- std(): Standard deviation

Expands to six (6) columns:

	- tBodyAcc-mean()-X
	- tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
	- tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
	- tBodyAcc-std()-X
	- tBodyAcc-std()-Y
	- tBodyAcc-std()-Z

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

mad(): Median absolute deviation 

max(): Largest value in array

min(): Smallest value in array

sma(): Signal magnitude area

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 

iqr(): Interquartile range 

entropy(): Signal entropy

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean

tBodyAccMean

tBodyAccJerkMean

tBodyGyroMean

tBodyGyroJerkMean
